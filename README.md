##README
This is my readme file for Horses.

This project is about the land the government set aside for wild herds of horses and how big energy companies are trying to cut in to the wild herds' lands.
The donation buttons do bring up a modal to fill out but the user information currently doesn't go anywhere.
There is also a newsletter button that toggles a sign-up for the newsletter.
